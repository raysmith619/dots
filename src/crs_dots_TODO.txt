How best to test/verify game strategies?

Commands / Menus:
snapshot / save state in loadable form (dots_commands.py)

step - run  game one move(micro-move)
unstep - backup game  one move(micro-move)

	Should Undo/ReDo act this way on running programs?
How should Undo/Redo act on running programs?
How should we handle this operation with possible random choices in auto players.
	step - make one step from manual, file, auto player algorithm
	unstep - backup to previous state (before step)
	undo (same as unstep)
	redo - place in state before previous undo
	
What duplication is useful? E.g. Run/Pause on multiple control windows.

Menu of game setups for easy setting
	Easy setting of players, game control, trace options
eg. Gp:level=-2 Gm:level=2 auto loop run
	Possibly integrated with game snapshots
